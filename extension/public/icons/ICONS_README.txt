Icon Files Needed
=================

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can:
1. Use the icon.svg file as a template
2. Generate PNGs from the SVG using a tool like Inkscape or ImageMagick
3. Create custom icons with your branding

For now, placeholder icons have been created. Replace them with proper icons for production.
